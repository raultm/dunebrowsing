# 002. Add custom header to identify response from SW or from Server

## Description

We want to identify if the response comes from the SW or from the server.

The idea is add a custom header with to options
- sw
- server

How to add custom header 

```
Custom proprietary headers have historically been used with an X- prefix, but this convention was deprecated in June 2012 because of the inconveniences it caused when nonstandard fields became standard in RFC 6648; others are listed in an IANA registry, whose original content was defined in RFC 4229. IANA also maintains a registry of proposed new HTTP headers.

## Service Worker funcionality

The important thing about the service worker is the addEventListener

```js
function addCustomOriginHeader(response, origin)
{
    const newHeaders = new Headers(response.headers);
    newHeaders.append('x-origin', origin);

    const customizedResponse = new Response(response.body, {
        status: response.status,
        statusText: response.statusText,
        headers: newHeaders
    });
    return customizedResponse
}
```
