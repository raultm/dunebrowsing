# 002. Register SW to hijack fetch

## Description

Attempt to test a basic service worker which hijack the fetch funcionality.

It must response with status 200 if page is cached (online/offline)

It must response with status 404 if page is not cached or is inexistent (online/offline)

## Service Worker funcionality

The important thing about the service worker is the addEventListener

```js
self.addEventListener('fetch', async function (event) {
    event.respondWith((async () => {
        const cachedResponsePromise = caches.match(event.request);
        const cachedResponse = await cachedResponsePromise.catch(err => console.log("Error on Cache Response"));
        if (cachedResponse) {
            console.log("Cached", event.request.url.pathname)
            return cachedResponse;
        }else{
            console.log("Not cached", event.request.url.pathname)
            return new Response({},{status:404, statusText:"Not Found"})
        }
    })())
});
```
